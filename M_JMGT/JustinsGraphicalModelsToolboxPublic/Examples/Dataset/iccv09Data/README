README FOR ICCV09DATA

This dataset contains 715 images sourced from LabelMe, MSRC, PASCAL
VOC, and Geometric Context. Labels were obtained using Amazon's
Mechanical Turk (AMT). The labels are:

  - horizons.txt         : image dimensions and location of horizon
  - labels/*.regions.txt : integer matrix indicating each pixel's
                           semantic class (sky, tree, road, grass,
                           water, building, mountain, or foreground
                           object). A negative number indicates
                           unknown.
 - labels/*.surfaces.txt : integer matrix indicating each pixel's
                           geometric class (sky, horizontal, or
                           vertical).
 - labels/*.layers.txt   : integer matrix indicating distinct
                           image regions.
