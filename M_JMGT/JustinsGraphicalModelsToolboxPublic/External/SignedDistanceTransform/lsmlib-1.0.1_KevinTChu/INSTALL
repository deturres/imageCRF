Installation Procedure
----------------------

(0.a) If you plan to use the samrai package, install SAMRAI and
      supporting libraries.

(0.b) If you plan to use the matlab package, install MATLAB and
      the MATLAB MEX compiler.  If you are not using the GNU compilers, 
      you may need to set up a special mex options file, mexopt.sh, file 
      for the compilers you are using.  A sample mex options file for
      the Intel compilers is provided in <LSMLIB_SOURCE_DIR>/config/matlab. 

(1)   Run 'configure' to set the configure options used to build LSMLIB
      on your platform and architecture.  Note that LSMLIB supports
      building the library within or outside of the source tree. Important 
      configure options for LSMLIB include:

      * SAMRAI configuration options
        --with-samrai=<path to directory where SAMRAI is installed>
        --without-samrai

      * MPICH configuration options
        --with-mpich=<path to directory where MPICH is installed>
        --without-mpich
      
      * OpenMPI configuration options
        --with-openmpi=<path to directory where OpenMPI is installed>
        --without-openmpi
      
      * LAM/MPI configuration options
        --with-lammpi=<path to directory where LAM/MPI is installed>
        --without-lammpi
      
      * MATLAB configuration options
        --with-matlab=<path to directory where MATLAB is installed>
        --with-matlab-install-dir=<directory where LSMLIB MATLAB files 
                                   are to be installed>
        --without-matlab
    
      * Installation options
        --prefix=<directory in which to install LSMLIB>
 
      * Option for building a single precision version of the library
        (by default, a double precision version of the library is built). 
        --enable-float

      * Optimization options
        --enable-opt
        --enable-debug
        --enable-profile
 
      * Compiler choices should be set via environment variables.
        CC:   C compiler
        CXX:  C++ compiler
        F77:  Fortran 77 compiler

      For a full list of configure options type 'configure -help'.  

      For example, to configure LSMLIB without SAMRAI and MPICH but with
      MATLAB, use the following 

      configure --without-samrai --without-mpich --with-matlab=<MATLAB_DIR>

      where MATLAB_DIR is the path to the directory where MATLAB is 
      installed on your system.

(2)   Run 'make' to build the entire library (except for the MATLAB
      MEX files).

(3)   Run 'make install' to install the library to the specified
      location.  The library is now ready for use.
      NOTE: The 'Makefile.config' file that may be helpful for developing
            software based on LSMLIB is located in the installation
            directory under share/LSMLIB/config/.

(4)   OPTIONAL.  'make dox' will build the documentation for LSMLIB and
                 place it in the $(SRC_DIR)/doc/lsmlib-dox directory (NOT
                 the build directory).  Note that the documentation comes 
                 pre-generated in the $(SRC_DIR)/doc/lsmlib-dox directory.

(5)   OPTIONAL.  Object files (but NOT the header files and library 
                 archives) may be removed by using 'make clean'.
                 NOTE: 'make clean' does NOT remove anything built
                 in the examples directory.

(6)   OPTIONAL.  'make spotless' may be used to remove ALL files
                 (including programs and output from the examples
                 directory) created during the build process, but
                 will leave the installed library intact.
