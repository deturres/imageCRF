% Description: MATLAB demo program for reinitialization
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This script demos reinitialization of level set functions to be distance
% functions near the zero level set.
%
% The initial level set function is
%
%    x.^2 + 0.2*y.^2 = 0.04
%
% The boundary condition is a large positive number in both coordinate 
% directions.
%
% In this code, reinitialization is done using WENO5 and TVD RK3.
