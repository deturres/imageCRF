% function [data,nx,ny,nz] = readDataArray(file_name)
%
% Reads a binary data file which contains 3 binary integers nx, ny, nz 
% indicating sizes of the array in each dimension, followed by an array
% of nx*ny*nz double precision real numbers.
% 
% Arguments:
% file_name - file name 
%
% Returns
% data      - double array read from the file
% nx,ny,nz  - array dimensions
