EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION -- FAST MARCHING METHOD

The examples in this directory show the usage of the fast marching method 
routines in the serial LSMLIB package.

The code in this directory demonstrate how to use LSMLIB to compute distance 
functions, compute extension fields, and solve the Eikonal equation.  In 
addition, MATLAB scripts for visualization of the results are provided.


COMPILATION
-----------
0. Build LSMLIB on your system.

1. Modify 'Makefile' to reflect the configuration of LSMLIB on your system.

If linking to the LSMLIB build directory, the first few lines of the Makefile
should be set as

  BUILD_DIR = < top level of LSMLIB build directory >
    include $(BUILD_DIR)/config/Makefile.config

If linking to the LSMLIB install directory, the first few lines of the
Makefile should be set as

  LSMLIB_DIR = < top level of LSMLIB install directory >
  include $(LSMLIB_DIR)/share/LSMLIB/config/Makefile.config

The rest of the Makefile shows how LSMLIB libraries should be linked when
building your own code.

2. Type 'make'. This should produce the executable named 'curvature_model' in
the current directory.


OUTPUT
------
1. 'computeDistanceFunction2d.dat'
Space-separated data file generated by computeDistanceFunction2d that 
contains the following field values for each point in the grid:

  distance_function, phi

2. 'computeDistanceFunction3d.dat'
Space-separated data file generated by computeDistanceFunction3d that 
contains the following field values for each point in the grid:

  distance_function, phi

3. 'computeExtensionFields2d.dat'
Space-separated data file generated by computeExtensionFields2d that 
contains the following field values for each point in the grid:

  distance_function, phi, ext_field_1, ext_field_2, src_field_1, src_field_2

4. 'solveEikonalEquation2d.dat'
Space-separated data file generated by solveEikonalEquation2d that 
contains the following field values for each point in the grid:

  phi, speed


VISUALIZATION
-------------
For each example program, a MATLAB script is provided for visualizing the 
results generated by the program and stored in the data file.
