/* lsm2dReinitializationMedium() reinitializes the level set 
 *   (i.e. near the zero level set it replaces the level set with a signed
 *   distance function).
 *
 *  Arguments:
 *  - lsm_arrays(in):  pointer to LSM_DataArrays structure
 *  - grid (in):       pointer to Grid
 *  - options (in):    pointer to Options structure
 *
 *  Return value:    none
 *   
 *  NOTES
 *    - Maximum running time for this function will be set to options->tmax.
 *      In reinitialization equation, the information travels at speed 1.
 *      Let dx[i] be grid spacing in direction i.
 *      tmax = M* max(dx[0],dx[1],dx[2]) means that we want to compute signed
 *      distance function in a band of M cells around zero level set. Therefore 
 *      it is suggested to set 'options->tmax' to a multiple of grid spacing.
