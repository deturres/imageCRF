  <h1> Overview </h1>

 <p>
 The Level Set Method Library (LSMLIB) provides support for the serial and
 parallel simulation of implicit surface and curve dynamics in two- and
 three-dimensions.  It contains an implementation of the basic level set
 method algorithms and numerical kernels described in "Level Set Methods and
 Dynamics Implicit Surfaces" by S. Osher and R. Fedkiw and "Level Set Methods
 and Fast Marching Methods" by J.A. Sethian.  It also contains implementations
 of several advanced level set method techniques available in the literature.
 </p>

  <p>
  The library consists of a collection of Fortran subroutines, C functions, 
  and C++ classes.  In addition, MATLAB interfaces are provided for several
  of the basic components of the level set method algorithm.
  The main features of the library include:
  </p>

  - High-computational and high-programmer performance through the use
    of mixed-language programming (e.g. C++/Fortran77, C/Fortran77,
    MATLAB/C/Fortran77);
  - Support for serial and parallel computation;
  - Support for narrow-band/localized computation;
  - Support for vector level set method calculations;
  - Restart capabilities.

  <h2> IMPORTANT NOTE:  </h2>
  This library is still under development and has not been thoroughly tested.  
  If you find a bug, please send me a bug report at 
  ktchu@serendipityresearch.org, and we will make an attempt to fix it in 
  the next release of the library.  Thank you for your patience during the 
  development process.

  <h1> LSMLIB Packages </h1>

  - @ref package_lsm_toolbox "Toolbox Package": 
    core algorithms and numerical kernels for level set method calculations
  - @ref package_lsm_serial "Serial Package": 
    high-level C data structures and algorithmic components for level set
    method computations on a single processor
  - @ref package_lsm_parallel "Parallel Package":
    C++ classes that encapsulate high-level algorithmic components of 
    parallel level set method computations
  - @ref package_lsm_matlab "MATLAB Toolbox":
    MATLAB interface for several components of the level set method algorithm

  <h1> Source Code Organization </h1>

  The top-level directory contains the following: 

  - INSTALL
  - LICENSE
  - CHANGE_LOG
  - configure, configure.ac
  - config/
  - doc/
  - src/
  - examples/

  INSTALL describes the simple installation procedure for the library.  
  LICENSE contains the license for LSMLIB.  CHANGE_LOG contains a 
  list of new features/bug fixes/etc. added to each new release of the 
  library.  'configure' is a shell script that automatically configures the 
  makefiles and build process for LSMLIB.  The config directory contains 
  template configuration files for the build process.  Configuration files
  that reflect the actual system setup are generated automatically by the 
  configure script.  The doc directory contains documentation on how to 
  use LSMLIB.  The examples directory contains several example codes that 
  demonstrate the basic usage of the library and may be used to test 
  functionality of the library.

  In addition to these files and directories, two additional directories are 
  added to the top-level directory after the build process:  include
  and lib.  These directories contain the header files and library archives
  for the Level Set Method library.  In addition, if the MATLAB mex files
  are built, they are placed in the lib/mex directory.

 <a name="dependencies">
 <h1> Software Dependencies </h1>

  The core library (i.e. @ref package_lsm_toolbox "LSMLIB Toolbox Package") 
  and @ref package_lsm_serial "Serial LSMLIB Package" do not depend on any 
  external software libraries.  The MATLAB Toolbox and Parallel Packages, 
  however, DO have external dependencies.  
  The @ref package_lsm_matlab "MATLAB LSMLIB Toolbox" depends on having a 
  MATLAB MEX compiler available.  
  The @ref package_lsm_parallel "Parallel LSMLIB Package" depends on the 
  <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/SAMRAI">SAMRAI</a> library, which in 
  turn requires the 
  <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library (required for 
  visualization and restart) and an 
  <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">MPI</a> library (required 
  to build parallel executables).
