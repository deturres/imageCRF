% computePlusAndMinusDerivatives1D() computes the upwind Hamilton-Jacobi
% spatial derivatives of the specified order for 1D grid functions.
%
% Usage: [phi_x_plus, phi_x_minus] = ...
%        computePlusAndMinusDerivatives1D(phi, ...
%                                         ghostcell_width, ...
%                                         dx, ...
%                                         spatial_derivative_order)
%
% Arguments:
% - phi:                       function for which to compute upwind 
%                                derivative
% - ghostcell_width:           number of ghostcells at boundary of 
%                                computational domain
% - dx:                        grid cell size
% - spatial_derivative_order:  spatial derivative order
%                                (default = 1)
%
% Return values:
% - phi_x_plus:                plus HJ ENO/WENO derivative
% - phi_x_minus:               minus HJ ENO/WENO derivative
%
% NOTES:
% - phi_x_plus and phi_x_minus have the same ghostcell width as phi.
