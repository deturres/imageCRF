 *
 * \brief 
 * The BoundaryConditionModule provides support for several common
 * boundary conditions for level set functions:  homogeneous Neumann,
 * extrapolation, and anti-periodic boundary conditions.  See the 
 * NOTES section for how to set periodic boundary conditions.
 *
 * In more detail, these boundary conditions are:
 * 
 * - Homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions set the ghost cells
 *   for the specified data so that the normal derivative of the 
 *   level set function at the boundary to zero.  The ghost cells
 *   are set in a manner that accounts for the type and order of 
 *   the discretization used to compute spatial derivatives.  For
 *   ENO1, ENO2, ENO3, and WENO5, this module simply fills ghost
 *   cells with data from the nearest neighbor in the interior
 *   of the computational domain. 
 *
 * - Extrapolation boundary conditions extend the level set functions
 *   into the ghost cells using simple extrapolation schemes.  There are 
 *   two types of extrapolation boundary conditions: unsigned and signed.  
 *   Unsigned extrapolation boundary conditions extend the level set 
 *   function using a simple linear extrapolation in the direction normal 
 *   to the boundary.  Signed extrapolation also extends the level set
 *   function values using a linear function, but the sign of the slope
 *   at the boundary is chosen to guarantee that the extrapolated level 
 *   set function does not have a value of zero in the extrapolation 
 *   direction.  
 * 
 * - Anti-periodic boundary conditions are periodic boundary 
 *   conditions where the sign of the function changes across the 
 *   "anti-periodic" boundary.  These boundary conditions are important 
 *   when the sign of the level set function changes across the periodic 
 *   boundary to avoid introducing artificial zero-level sets into the 
 *   level set functions at the periodic boundary.  
 *
 *   When the sign of the level set function in the interior of the 
 *   computational domain is the same on both sides of a periodic boundary, 
 *   then the values in the ghostcells outside of the physical domain are 
 *   set equal to the value of the grid cells taken from grid cells on the 
 *   other side of the computational domain.  However, when the sign of the 
 *   level set function in the interior of the computational domain changes 
 *   across a periodic boundary, the values in the ghostcells outside of the 
 *   physical domain are set to minus the value of the grid cells taken from
 *   grid cells on the other side of the computational domain.  
 *
 * <h3> NOTES: </h3>
 *
 * - To impose PERIODIC boundary conditions in a coordinate direction,
 *   set that coordinate direction to be a periodic direction for the 
 *   CartesianGridGeometry object (may be set in the input file) and
 *   set the boundary condition type to NONE. 
 * 
 * - In order for anti-periodic boundary conditions to be used in a 
 *   coordinate direction, the GridGeometry associated with the 
 *   PatchHierarchy MUST be set to be periodic in that coordinate 
 *   direction.  This ensures that data is properly transferred from
 *   the interior grid cells at the opposite side of the computational
 *   grid.
 *
 * - To guarantee that anti-periodic boundary conditions are correctly
 *   imposed, the level set function must truly be anti-periodic.  In
 *   particular, the initial conditions for the level set functions MUST
 *   be anti-periodic.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that 
 *   the initial conditions for level set functions are appropriately 
 *   set when s/he chooses to impose anti-periodic boundary conditions.
