/*! \class LSMLIB::OrthogonalizationAlgorithm
 *
 * \brief
 * OrthogonalizationAlgorithm is a utility class that provides support for 
 * orthogonalizing two level set functions, phi and psi. 
 *
 * This goal is achieved by solving either of the two following 
 * orthogonalization equations:
 *
 * \f[
 *
 *   \phi_t + sgn(\psi) * ( \nabla \psi / |\nabla \psi| ) \cdot \nabla \phi = 0
 *
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *
 *   \psi_t + sgn(\phi) * ( \nabla \phi / |\nabla \phi| ) \cdot \nabla \psi = 0
 *
 * \f]
 *
 * which evolve either \f$ \phi \f$ or \f$ \psi \f$ until \f$ \nabla \phi \f$ 
 * and \f$ \nabla \psi \f$ are.  
 * orthogonal.  These Hamilton-Jacobi equations are advanced in time towards 
 * steady-state using a user-specified TVD Runge-Kutta method.  The number 
 * of steps taken is a function of the user-specified input parameters: 
 * stop_distance, max_iterations, and iteration_stop_tolerance.  The 
 * numerical discretization used to compute \f$ \nabla \phi \f$ and 
 * \f$ \nabla \psi \f$ are also user-specified.  In the first of the above 
 * equation, \f$ \nabla \psi \f$ is computed using by taking the average 
 * of the forward and backward spatial derivatives, and \f$ \nabla \phi \f$ 
 * is computed via a simple upwinding scheme that treats \f$ \nabla \psi \f$ 
 * as the velocity.  In the second of the above equations, the reverse 
 * procedure is used to compute \f$ \nabla \phi \f$ and \f$ \nabla \psi \f$.
 *
 *
 * <h3> USAGE: </h3>
 *
 *  -# Set up level set functions and initialize the level set calculation
 *     (e.g. using the LevelSetMethodAlgorithm class).
 *  -# Create a OrthogonalizationAlgorithm object.
 *  -# Invoke @ref resetHierarchyConfiguration() if PatchHierarchy 
 *     configuration of has been changed since last orthogonalization 
 *     procedure. 
 *  -# Orthogonalize level set functions using the 
 *     @ref orthogonalizeLevelSetFunctions() or the
 *     @ref orthogonalizeLevelSetFunctionForSingleComponent() methods.
 *
 * 
 * <h3> User-specified parameters </h3>
 * 
 * - spatial_derivative_type    = type of spatial derivative calculation
 * - spatial_derivative_order   = order of spatial derivative
 * - tvd_runge_kutta_order      = order of TVD Runge-Kutta integration
 * - cfl_number                 = CFL number (default = 0.5)
 * - stop_distance              = approximate stopping criterion for  
 *                                evolution of orthogonalization equation.
 *                                Orthogonalization terminates after the
 *                                information from the zero level set has
 *                                propagated by approximately the specified
 *                                distance.  (default = 0.0)
 * - max_iterations             = maximum number of time steps to take during
 *                                the orthogonalization process (default = 0)
 * - iteration_stop_tolerance   = stopping criterion for termination of 
 *                                evolution of orthogonalization equation.
 *                                Orthogonalization stops when the max norm
 *                                of the change in the level set function
 *                                drops below the specified tolerance.
 *                                (default = 0.0)
 * - verbose_mode               = flag to activate/deactivate verbose-mode 
 *                                (default = false)
 *
 *
 * <h3> NOTES: </h3>
 *
 * - If no stopping criteria are specified, the orthogonalization
 *   calculation is terminated using the stop_distance criterion
 *   with the stop_distance set to the length of the largest 
 *   dimension of the computational domain.  This choice ensures
 *   that the level set functions are orthogonalized throughout the 
 *   entire computational domain.
 * 
 * - Unless it is important that the gradients of the level set 
 *   functions are orthogonal to very high accuracy, it is 
 *   recommended that orthogonalization is done using a low-order
 *   spatial discretization and time integration scheme (e.g. ENO1 and 
 *   TVD Runge-Kutta 1).  This will significantly improve preformance.
 *
 * - An orthogonalization calculation that extends throughout the
 *   entire domain can take a rather large amount of computational
 *   time.  The calculation may be sped up by specifying a smaller
 *   stop_distance (which effectively limits the distance off of
 *   the zero level sets that the level set functions are 
 *   orthogonalized) or using a lower order spatial-and time-discretization.
