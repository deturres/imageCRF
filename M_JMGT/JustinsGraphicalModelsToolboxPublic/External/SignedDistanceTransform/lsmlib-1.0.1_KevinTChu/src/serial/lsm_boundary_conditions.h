 *
 * \brief
 * @ref lsm_boundary_conditions.h provides support for filling 
 * ghostcells to impose several common level set method boundary 
 * conditions in two- and three-dimensions.  Support is provided 
 * for extrapolation and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
 * Boundary conditions are imposed by filling ghostcells outside 
 * of the computational domain in such a way that they produce
 * the desired boundary condition.  
 *

 * same as linear extrapolation except that the sign of the slope 
 * used in extrapolation is chosen to ensure that the value of the 
 * level set function in the ghostcells move "away" from the zero 
 * level set.  This choice ensures that we do not accidentally introduce 
 * spurious zero level sets when we impose boundary conditions.
 * 
 * Mathematically, the extrapolation function is 
 *
 * \f[
 *
 *   \phi(s) = \phi(s_b) + sgn(\phi) |d\phi/dn (s_b)| (s - s_b)
 *
 * \f]

 * is the value of \f$ s \f$ on the boundary.

 *  - grid (in):               pointer to Grid data structure
