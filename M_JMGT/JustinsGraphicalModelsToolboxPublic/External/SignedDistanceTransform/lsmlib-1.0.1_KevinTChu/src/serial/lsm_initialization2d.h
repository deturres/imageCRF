 * @ref lsm_initialization2d.h provides support for creating level set 
 * functions which possess zero level sets corresponding to common 
 * geometrical objects in two-dimensions.  These can be used as initial 
 * conditions for level set method calculations or masks for computations 
 * in restricted domains.  Whenever possible, the level set function is

 * through the computational domain.  The line is assumed to be represented
 * in the form:
 *
 *   normal_x * (x - point_x) + normal_y * (y - point_y) = 0.
 *
 * Arguments
 *  - phi (out):      level set function
 *  - normal_x (in):  the x-coordinate for the normal vector
 *                    to the line
 *  - normal_y (in):  the y-coordinate for the normal vector
 *                    to the line

 *                    on the line 
 *  - grid (in):      pointer to Grid data structure 
 *
 * Return value:      none

 * NOTES: 
 * - Is it the user's responsibility to ensure that memory for phi
 *   has been allocated.
 *
 * - The normal vector is assumed to be an ``outside'' normal; that is, the 
 *   normal vector should point from the region where phi is negative to
