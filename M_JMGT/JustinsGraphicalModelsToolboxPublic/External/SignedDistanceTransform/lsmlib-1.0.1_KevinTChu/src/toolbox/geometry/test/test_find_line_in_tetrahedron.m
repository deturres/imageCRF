% This script is intended to be used in conjunction with the 
% test_find_line_in_tetrahedron* test programs to verify the correctness 
% of the fineLineInTetrahedron function().  
% 
% This script computes the coefficients for the linear approximation for
% phi and psi within a tetrahedron.  It also computes the line corresponding
% to the intersection of the two planes, and checks whether the specified
% points lie on the line.
%
% Usage: 
% - set coordinates of corners of tetrahedron and 
% - set values of phi and psi at corners
% - set points to check
% - run script
