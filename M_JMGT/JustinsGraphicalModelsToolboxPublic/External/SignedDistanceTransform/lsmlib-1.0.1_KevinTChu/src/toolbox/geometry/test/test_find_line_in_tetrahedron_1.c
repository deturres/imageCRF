/*
 * This program tests that the LSM3D_findLineInTetrahedron() function 
 * correctly computes the coefficients of the linear approximation to the 
 * level set functions and the {phi=0,psi=0} line.  It does NOT test that 
 * the endpoints of the line intersecting the tetrahedron are correctly 
 * computed.
 *
 * The corners of the tetrahedron were arbitrarily chosen.  The values of 
 * phi and psi at the corners were computed using alpha and beta vectors
 * chosen to test the different cases in the LSM3D_findLineInTetrahedron()
 * function.
 *
 * The alpha and beta vectors are defined so that: 
 *
 * phi = alpha_0 + alpha_1*x + alpha_2*y + alpha_3*z
 * psi = beta_0 + beta_1*x + beta_2*y + beta_3*z
 *
 * NOTE: Use of this test program requires commenting out the check to
 *       see if there the {phi=0,psi=0} line intersects the tetrahedron 
 *       and putting printf() statements in the LSM3D_findLineInTetrahedron() 
 *       function to print out:
 *       (1)  the coefficients of the linear approximations to phi and psi
 *       (2)  the point on the {phi=0,psi=0} line
 *       (3)  the direction of the {phi=0,psi=0} line
